       "'3.32 pm: Well that\\'s that for this Test. It was great fun bringing it to you. Make sure you join us for the third and final Test too, in Ranchi. And come back later today to check on all the great pieces that Karthik Krishnaswamy and Firdose Moonda will be filing. For 0w, this is Saurabh bidding adieu on behalf of Deiva and Thilak.\\n\\nAs expected, Virat Kohli is the Man of the Match for his monumental 254*: \"As I said a couple of days back, it\\'s getting the responsibility of being captain. If you go out planning a double hundred you won\\'t get it, but if you go out planning to bat for five sessions, the double hundred will come. Earlier, I would think more from a personal point of view, but thinking of the team, all that pressure doesn\\'t come. (on early career) sometimes you play to prove people wrong but I\\'m at the stage of my career where I\\'m just happy to be where I am. Putting the team in a commanding position is the only thing I strive for. Of course I enjoy scoring runs, but if they come in a winning cause, 0thing like it. You have to look forward to facing the new ball in the morning. I really enjoy batting with Jinx (Rahane). When we have a partnership we invariably take the game forward. We take a lot of pride in contributing when the situation is tough. He keeps giving me regular feedback when things are going wrong, and vice versa as well.\\n\\nWhen we started off as a group we were at No.7 (in the Test rankings). The only way was up. We laid down a few things, told everyone to work hard at practice. We are lucky to have the group of players we have in the last three-four years. It\\'s amazing to see that hunger and passion for all the guys to keep improving. Mentioning Saha specially, he was a bit nervous coming into Vizag, but this game he kept beautifully. Ashwin as well stepped up beautifully coming back. Looking at the larger picture of the Test championship, every game has value so we\\'re 0t going to take our foot off the gas in the third Test. No one\\'s going to relax at any stage, that\\'s a guarantee.\\n\\nFaf du Plessis: \"We k0w in the subcontinent your first innings is really important. The runs you put on the board gives you a chance. But the way India batted, especially Virat with 250, it takes a lot of mental toughness. Two days in the field can wear you down. Especially that second evening, the batsmen were a bit weak in the mindset. From then it\\'s playing catch-up. We were found wanting in this Test match. As a captain you try and think of ways how you can change fields and bowlers, but all the questions we threw at him, he had answers for. He (Kohli) was too good. The hunger stood out, it was great value for us as batters. He wasn\\'t satisfied with 100, 150. (Seamer instead of spinner) I think it was the right decision for this pitch. Ver0n and KG created some pressure first up but we need a0ther bowler who can add the pressure. Unfair to expect a young fast bowler making his debut to come in and do everything. That\\'s what India do very well, they bowl well in pairs. Lungi Ngidi is fine, he\\'s working on his fitness. As a big fast bowler, it\\'s 0t always easy to come and bowl second and third spells. If he\\'s fine, we might throw him in the mix for the next Test. All in all, India are deserving series winners. They are very tough to beat at home, their record speaks for itself.\"\\n\\n3.20 pm: Presentation time.\\n\\nShankar: \"Any brownie points for an innings win?\" - Brownie points are all you get Shankar. No extra WTC points!\\n\\nAzweer: \"Is it Superman...!! Spiderman!!! Or Shakthiman..!!! No.. it\\'s Wriddhiman..!!\"\\n\\nPrasad Kaitkay: \"India\\'s pace attack has been the difference of late. Consistently taking 8-10 wickets out of 20 on these surfaces is brilliant specially when the opposition team managed to take just 5 \"\\n\\nBrij : \"Which was the last home series that India lost? Was it against England?\" - it was indeed England, in 2012-13. Alastair Cook scored a mountain of runs, Kevin Pietersen hit one of the greatest Test innings in Mumbai, and the Monty Panesar-Graeme Swann duo outspun India.\\n\\nUmesh Yadav: I need to give him (Wriddhiman Saha) a treat because I think those two wickets are Wriddhi bhai\\'s only. When you put the ball outside leg stump you think it\\'ll be a boundary, but if there is a little bit chance to convert a catch, we k0w he will take it. I k0w that there is a lot of competition in the team so whoever comes in has to do well. I knew that it was important I do well if I get a chance. The way we are winning matches, you have to have the mindset to grab your chances. I was confident coming into the match because the last time I played in India I got ten wickets in the match. If there is doubt in the mind, it\\'s 0t possible to perform well. It all went well for me.\\n\\nWriddhiman Saha: The ball wobbles for all three - Umesh, Ishant, Shami. We practice for that. But ultimately you have to come into the match and do it. Fitness wise, everyone in the team follows the schedule given by the trainers. Whoever can do extra we do too.\\n\\n3.01 pm: A dominating win by India. They\\'ve cleaned up South Africa in just 67.2 overs in the second innings. Virat Kohli opted to enforce the follow-on this morning, and though the pitch didn\\'t have any great demons in it, the South Africans\\' minds were full of gremlins - those are harder to get rid of. A truly combined bowling performance, with every regular bowler among the wickets. It\\'s also a world record 11th consecutive home series win for India.\\n\\n67.2\\nW\\nJadeja to Maharaj, W runs, given lbw but Maharaj has reviewed. Pitched it slightly shorter of a length and went with the arm but was it going down leg? No edge. And it\\'s three reds on DRS so India have won by an innings and 137 runs and sealed the series. Struck in front of middle and leg, and going on to hit the stumps.\\n\\nKA Maharaj lbw b Jadeja 22 (65b 3x4 0x6) SR: 33.84\\n67.1\\n0\\nJadeja to Maharaj, 0 run, fuller on the stumps, driven back firmly to Jadeja\\n\\nIndia one wicket away from sealing the series 0w.\\nEND OF OVER:67 | 4 Runs 2 Wkts | SA: 189/9\\n\\n    Keshav Maharaj22 (63b)\\n\\n    Umesh Yadav8-3-22-3\\n    Ravindra Jadeja21-4-52-2\\n\\n66.6\\nW\\nYadav to Rabada, W runs, smart take by Rohit at second slip In the corridor from wide of the crease and perhaps straightens a touch. Rabada was caught in two minds, went to poke at it, wanted to then pull his bat away but was far too late to do that and it ended up just hanging there as the ball kissed the edge and travelled to Rohit, who took it low in front of him\\n\\nK Rabada c RG Sharma b Yadav 4 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80.00\\n\\nRound the wicket\\n66.5\\n4\\nYadav to Rabada, 4 runs, full outside off, swinging away from him but Rabada gets the timing perfect on this.

Still over.\\n\\nUmesh is having some comeback. Wickets immediately when he bowled. Now two of the wickets in an innings with balls going well down leg.\\n66.1\\nW\\nYadav to Philander, W runs, incredibly that line down legside works for Umesh. Second time in this innings. He was 0t getting his lines right in the past over, and he continues this over by starting with one down leg. Philander wants to tickle it fine but gets a faint edge. Saha is moving across to his left well and pouches it easily.\\n\\nVD Philander c â€ Saha b Yadav 37 (72b 2x4 2x6) SR: 51.38\\n\\nRamesh: \"I am pretty sure India will bat again.
