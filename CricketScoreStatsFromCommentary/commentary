3.32 pm: Well that's that for this Test. It was great fun bringing it to you. Make sure you join us for the third and final Test too, in Ranchi. And come back later today to check on all the great pieces that Karthik Krishnaswamy and Firdose Moonda will be filing. For now, this is Saurabh bidding adieu on behalf of Deiva and Thilak.

As expected, Virat Kohli is the Man of the Match for his monumental 254*: "As I said a couple of days back, it's getting the responsibility of being captain. If you go out planning a double hundred you won't get it, but if you go out planning to bat for five sessions, the double hundred will come. Earlier, I would think more from a personal point of view, but thinking of the team, all that pressure doesn't come. (on early career) sometimes you play to prove people wrong but I'm at the stage of my career where I'm just happy to be where I am. Putting the team in a commanding position is the only thing I strive for. Of course I enjoy scoring runs, but if they come in a winning cause, nothing like it. You have to look forward to facing the new ball in the morning. I really enjoy batting with Jinx (Rahane). When we have a partnership we invariably take the game forward. We take a lot of pride in contributing when the situation is tough. He keeps giving me regular feedback when things are going wrong, and vice versa as well.

When we started off as a group we were at No.7 (in the Test rankings). The only way was up. We laid down a few things, told everyone to work hard at practice. We are lucky to have the group of players we have in the last three-four years. It's amazing to see that hunger and passion for all the guys to keep improving. Mentioning Saha specially, he was a bit nervous coming into Vizag, but this game he kept beautifully. Ashwin as well stepped up beautifully coming back. Looking at the larger picture of the Test championship, every game has value so we're not going to take our foot off the gas in the third Test. No one's going to relax at any stage, that's a guarantee.

Faf du Plessis: "We know in the subcontinent your first innings is really important. The runs you put on the board gives you a chance. But the way India batted, especially Virat with 250, it takes a lot of mental toughness. Two days in the field can wear you down. Especially that second evening, the batsmen were a bit weak in the mindset. From then it's playing catch-up. We were found wanting in this Test match. As a captain you try and think of ways how you can change fields and bowlers, but all the questions we threw at him, he had answers for. He (Kohli) was too good. The hunger stood out, it was great value for us as batters. He wasn't satisfied with 100, 150. (Seamer instead of spinner) I think it was the right decision for this pitch. Vernon and KG created some pressure first up but we need another bowler who can add the pressure. Unfair to expect a young fast bowler making his debut to come in and do everything. That's what India do very well, they bowl well in pairs. Lungi Ngidi is fine, he's working on his fitness. As a big fast bowler, it's not always easy to come and bowl second and third spells. If he's fine, we might throw him in the mix for the next Test. All in all, India are deserving series winners. They are very tough to beat at home, their record speaks for itself."

3.20 pm: Presentation time.

Shankar: "Any brownie points for an innings win?" - Brownie points are all you get Shankar. No extra WTC points!

Azweer: "Is it Superman...!! Spiderman!!! Or Shakthiman..!!! No.. it's Wriddhiman..!!"

Prasad Kaitkay: "India's pace attack has been the difference of late. Consistently taking 8-10 wickets out of 20 on these surfaces is brilliant specially when the opposition team managed to take just 5 "

Brij : "Which was the last home series that India lost? Was it against England?" - it was indeed England, in 2012-13. Alastair Cook scored a mountain of runs, Kevin Pietersen hit one of the greatest Test innings in Mumbai, and the Monty Panesar-Graeme Swann duo outspun India.

Umesh Yadav: I need to give him (Wriddhiman Saha) a treat because I think those two wickets are Wriddhi bhai's only. When you put the ball outside leg stump you think it'll be a boundary, but if there is a little bit chance to convert a catch, we know he will take it. I know that there is a lot of competition in the team so whoever comes in has to do well. I knew that it was important I do well if I get a chance. The way we are winning matches, you have to have the mindset to grab your chances. I was confident coming into the match because the last time I played in India I got ten wickets in the match. If there is doubt in the mind, it's not possible to perform well. It all went well for me.

Wriddhiman Saha: The ball wobbles for all three - Umesh, Ishant, Shami. We practice for that. But ultimately you have to come into the match and do it. Fitness wise, everyone in the team follows the schedule given by the trainers. Whoever can do extra we do too.

3.01 pm: A dominating win by India. They've cleaned up South Africa in just 67.2 overs in the second innings. Virat Kohli opted to enforce the follow-on this morning, and though the pitch didn't have any great demons in it, the South Africans' minds were full of gremlins - those are harder to get rid of. A truly combined bowling performance, with every regular bowler among the wickets. It's also a world record 11th consecutive home series win for India.

Jadeja to Maharaj, OUT, given lbw but Maharaj has reviewed. Pitched it slightly shorter of a length and went with the arm but was it going down leg? No edge. And it's three reds on DRS so India have won by an innings and 137 runs and sealed the series. Struck in front of middle and leg, and going on to hit the stumps.

Yadav to Rabada, OUT, smart take by Rohit at second slip In the corridor from wide of the crease and perhaps straightens a touch. Rabada was caught in two minds, went to poke at it, wanted to then pull his bat away but was far too late to do that and it ended up just hanging there as the ball kissed the edge and travelled to Rohit, who took it low in front of him

Yadav to Philander, OUT, incredibly that line down legside works for Umesh. Second time in this innings. He was not getting his lines right in the past over, and he continues this over by starting with one down leg. Philander wants to tickle it fine but gets a faint edge. Saha is moving across to his left well and pouches it easily.

Simha Y.N: "Maharaj and Philander remind me of the famous Aussie late order pair - Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson. Very, very annoying underrated batsmen. They hung on like limpets, much like the two here are showing us. The most famous instance of this for me was the tied test of 1960-61, where it seemed the Windies had won when the Aussies were seven down, only for those two to come together and produce that unforgettable climax.

2.24 pm: There's another remarkable stat, dug up by our stats editor S Rajesh: how quickly the Maharaj-Philander pair are creeping up the list of most balls faced for South Africa for the last three wickets.

How good has Wriddhiman Saha been behind the stumps? Even before his Superman acts today, Ashwin had said how Saha was a fantastic keeper to have for a spinner.

2.20 pm: Thanks Deiva. South Africa went in to tea on Day 3 with Philander and Maharaj at the crease. They've gone into tea at Day 4 with the same pair batting...

Sureshy Reddy: "Bring on Ishant and Umesh /shami . Bowl short . Keep the fields accordingly . Spinners aren't troubling Maharaj-Philander pair and they will easily take the match to 5th day ...."

2.10pm Tea: South Africa are 155 runs away from making India bat again. Jadeja got rid of both Bavuma and de Kock this session before second-innings Shami let it rip with his bouncers. Philander and Maharaj - SA's first-innings batting heroes - have held up India's march in this innings as well. Saurabh will be back with you in about 20 minutes for the final session of the day. Will it be the final session of the game as well?

Mohammed Shami to Muthusamy, OUT, Fended to second slip! This is a snorter from Shami. Back of a length, angling in from round the stumps, then kicks away outside off. Not too dissimilar from the Nortje dismissal - except Muthusamy is a left-hander. You can't do anything but fend at it, hoping it doesn't carry. This, however, flies through to Rohit.

With the departures of Steyne, Amla and ABD, this series kick started the actual transition period for South Africa. To expect them to to go Toe to Toe with this Indian team is frankly quite harsh on them. They are entering the next chapter of their cricketing history just like Australia did after 2007 and India after 2011 WC with the departures of SRT, Dravid, VVS, Sehwag, Zaheer etc. in subsequent years." --- Shami will continue.

Jadeja to Bavuma, OUT, Rahane pulls off a stunner at slip forget that review off the previous ball, Bavuma's gone now. Tossed up and Bavuma is drawn into the drive, but it drifts and turns, clips his outside edge and goes very fine. Excellent reflexes by Rahane who sticks out his left hand near shoulder height and then the right hand closes around the ball too to ensure it doesn't pop out anywhere - all while diving to his left.

Jadeja to Bavuma, no run, huge appeal by Jadeja as Bavuma misses the sweep and Kohli reviews. Pitches on off and is turning away, I think Bavuma will be saved by the impact, and that might miss the stumps too. And in fact that's exactly what has happened. That's a poor review. Impact well outside off and turning further away so it's inevitably missing off by a long way too

Arunabh : "Also, in the appreciation of Wriddhi's wicket keeping skills lets not forget that he is a pretty sound and technical batters who bats with intelligently and with level headed approach. This guy has its own set of followers in my work place. A true unsung hero. "

12.11 pm: All set to restart. Ashwin to de Kock. All fielders inside the circle.

12.08 pm: We're a short way away from the second session, and here's an interesting nugget from our resident stats genius Gaurav Sundararaman on Ashwin's bowling this series:

v left-hand batsmen - 5 wickets @ 30.20 v right-hand batsmen - 9 wickets @ 12.66

Quite a reversal from his career figures, which are 20.23 (LHB) and 30.60 (RHB)

KedarKshirsagar: "I was pleasantly shocked to see India enforcing follow-on today but if this is going to be a usual thing due to Test Championship, bowlers are going to be pushed to their limits. It's a good thing that Indian bowling is seeing its golden era right now with all quality bowlers waiting for their turns." - I think it's entirely driven by the match situation, opposition and resources available. The Test Championship has at best a peripheral role in the decision.

Aakash Chopra says the upper crust has crumbled a bit on this pitch but if you put your mind to it, it's still a good pitch to bat on.

At 74 for 4, trailing by 252 still while following on though, the mind plays as many tricks as the pitch does.

Nitin Gupta: "After Elgar now Ashwin jumped two positions in most test wickets, and he is at no 23 now to take most wickets. What an Achievement, applaud "

11.55 am: Lunch-time reading. Revisit this magnificent piece that seamlessly marries cricket analysis with an articular player's thoughts - Karthik Krishnaswamy wrote on R Ashwin in the first Test, when he marked his comeback with seven wickets.

11.30am So, India are six wickets away from wrapping up an innings victory and the series. SA still need 253 runs to make India bat again. After Kohli enforced the follow-on, South Africa lost Markram again for a duck. Saha then flew parallel to the ground to send back No.3 De Bryun, leaving the visitors at 21 for 2. Faf du Plessis, who bumped him to No.4, and Dean Elgar offered some resistance before Ashwin removed both batsmen to keep India on course. We will be back in 40 minutes for the post-lunch session.

Ian Chappell weighs in on Rohit's promotion to the top in Test cricket

JagZ: "It's Saha who actually got the wicket of de Bruyn in both innings - Yadav just happened to be the bowler, especially the second innings caught down leg"

Pradeep Narayan: "The last 2 wickets have shown that Wridhi and Umesh have great temperament and on a lighter note...gr8 jugglers too ;)...there would be some spl training been provided by the coaching staff for Plans B,C...whenever such juggling situation happens ;)"

Ashwin loops it up on off, dips and turns. Elgar isn't quite close enough to the pitch and winds up slicing the ball as opposed to lofting it. He was aiming to hit it over mid-on, but Umesh grabs it on the rebound from mid-off. Sixth in the game for Ashwin

That's drinks and my cue to rub hands in glee and hand it over to Deiva Muthu who'll be typing furiously to deal with Ashwin and Jadeja, whenever he comes on.

Ashwin to du Plessis, no run, loop, dip and turn, defeats his forward defensive and hits him on the pad. Loud appeal but maybe that ball was doing too much

Ashwin to du Plessis, no run, that's pinged short leg Rohit Sharma the man there. Too short and he goes for the hard sweep, nails it too, but that's hit Rohit who was turning and taking evasive action. No damage done

Mohammed Shami to Elgar, no run, oh that's a nasty short ball. It reared up from back of a length and he was going for the pull but then decided to not go for it a little too late. Bangs into his bat and almost pings him on the grille. Popped up and dropped near him

Keith: "I'm an old, grumpy traditionalist who hates such things as the numbers on the backs of the shirts, but I think KT's suggestion about changing the follow on rule is quite reasonable. "

Sai Teja: "Team India's selection this series has been spot on. Right from bringing in Rohit as an opener to realising that Ashwin is still your no.1 test spinner. Also, purely as a wicket keeper, Saha fits in better than Pant. And the decision of playing an extra seamer in Pune is proving crucial."

Yadav to du Plessis, no run, too far down leg and he can't get near it while trying to glance

KT: "I am of the view, the follow on can be in case team has scored less than 50% or 60% of runs scored by team batting first. The lead of 200 is very old rule and should be changed. " - that's an interesting idea.

Yadav to Elgar, 2 runs, sweet timing but pulled inside the point boundary by Agarwal. Wide of off stump and very full, he reaches for it with his hands and pings it past point. Wasn't exactly safe since it hung in the air a bit

Kapil Baldawa: "Both those wickets were absolute gifts to India, of course one by a blinder by Saha. But question is, why do you need to play at that? It's not on stumps, so leave them alone" - well some of the credit for the batsman playing at that must go to the bowlers. Umesh had kept him on a tight leash with his line and when he saw an opportunity to score he went for it.

Ashraf: "I think Faf kept an eye on cricinfo poll. " - well of course, who wouldn't?

Eventful first two overs. South Africa have had a batsman out who should have reviewed. A run out opportunity. A catch dropped. Markram will be feeling the pinch of not reviewing. Elgar will be feeling the burden of not having asked his partner to review. De Bruyn is likely playing for his place. And India's bowlers are breathing fire.

I Sharma to Markram, OUT, Markram has a pair. What a start for India and Ishant. Markram is out almost the same way he was in the first innings, but to a different bowler. This one bent in sharply once again, but Ishant bowled it more full and straight than the first ball and Markram is struck on the pads. Was it going down? The umpire raises his finger after a loud appeal. They think about reviewing, but I suspect that would have been umpire's call on review.

I Sharma to Markram, no run, oh my, that one came back in a long way. But safe enough to leave because it was going over the stumps. Not great for your mindset as a batsman when the first ball does that

9.29 am: Right, the teams are out in the middle. Three slips and a gully with Markram facing. Elgar at the non-striker's end. Ishant has the ball. He wasn't at his best in the first innings, and his problems were compounded by being warned twice for treading on the danger area. But he's been superb in general, so he'll be looking to make amends.
